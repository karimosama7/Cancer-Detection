This project aims to devning models for the early and accurate detection of various cancer types, leveraging specialized medical imaging datasets. By using diverse datasets across multiple cancer types, we strive to enhance diagnostic accuracy and enable prompt medical interventions. Hereâ€™s an overview of each dataset and the imaging techniques they utilize:

Melanoma Skin Cancer: This dataset consists of 10,000 images, including 9,600 for model training and 1,000 for evaluation. Melanoma is a potentially deadly form of skin cancer, and early detection is crucial for improving survival rates. This dataset enables the development of classification models to detect melanoma from skin images accurim2ging.

Kidney Cancer (CT Scans): This dataset includes CT scans specifically targeted for kidney cancer detection. Using advanced imaging techniques, it supports the identification of cancerous formations within the kidney structure, aiding in the c mahcineon of deep learning models focused on early di3gnosis.

Lung Cancer (IQ-OTH/NCCD CT Scans): Collected from the Iraq-Oncology Teaching Hospital and National Center for Cancer Diseases, 
this dataset includes 1,190 CT scan slices from 110 cases, classified into normal, benign, and malignant categories.
The scans were annotated by oncologists and radiologists,and the dataset provides a comprehensive view of the human chest at various angles and depths. 
The scans are categorized by the disease stage and offer a range of patient demographics, 
making this dataset valuable for modeling lung cancer across divent of cancer.
